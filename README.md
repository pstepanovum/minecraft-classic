- [x] Implement block collision detection
- [x] Allow players to add and remove blocks across the server
- [x] Set up project structure (frontend/backend)
- [x] Implement basic Three.js rendering
- [x] Create simple cube-based world
- [x] Add tree generation for terrain (Part)
- [x] Implement cave generation (Part)
- [x] Add water features to the world (Part)
- [x] Implement player rotation visible to all connected players

### 🌟🌟🌟🌟 25 Stars - Player Interactions and UI
